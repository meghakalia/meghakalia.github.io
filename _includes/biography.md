I am a Post-doctoral Fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, working in self-supervised computer vision and machine learning for medical robotics. I completed my PhD in Electrical & Computer Engineering at the Robotics and Control Lab (RCL), University of British Columbia (UBC), supervised by Prof. Tim Salcudean and Prof. Nassir Navab from the Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany. I did my master's at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, India. In the past, I have also been a DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service) scholar at TUM, Germany, a Friedman Scholar at New York University, USA, and a Public Scholar at UBC, Vancouver. When not working, I am either running, biking, or reading a book.
