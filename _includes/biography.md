I am a PhD candidate at [Robotics and Control Lab][RCL], University of British Columbia (UBC). I am co-supervised by Prof [Tim Salcudean][TIM] at UBC and Prof [Nassir Navab][NAVAB] from Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany. I received my Master of Technology (M.Tech) from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, India in Medical Imaging and Informatics. During my masters, I received DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service) scholarship to spent 7 months at [Chair for Computer Aided Medical Procedures & Augmented Reality (CAMPAR)][CAMPAR], TUM under the supervision of Prof. Nassir Navab to finish my thesis. I received the Govt. of India AICTE fellowship for the whole duration of my masters.

My research lies at the intersection of human perception inspired AR/MR, human computer interaction, computer vision and perception in robotics.

I have been a recipient of the [Friedman Award][Friedman], [Public Scholars Initiative][PSI] award, have been in [UBC press][UBC PRESS] and have received a Best Paper Award (Bench-to-Bedside Category) and an Outstanding Paper Award for my PhD research.

Currently, I am part of the steering committee of [Biomedical Imaging and Artificial Intelligence Research Cluster][BIAIRC], UBC. In the past, I have served as a member of Graduate Council Student Caucus, UBC and as an executive committee member, Women in Engineering, UBC.

When I am not working you can find me either running, biking, or reading a book. Fun fact: During my PhD I have managed to read more than 60 fiction/non-fiction books so far. Things that I am learning currently: North Indian vocal classical music.
